-------------INTRO---------------
This program is freeware! (but if you really like it and you
want to make a donation, feel free to do so!  Also feel free
to email me and tell me how much you like it.)

I am a beginning programmer and I had a hard time finding
source code to learn from, so to help any other beginners
out there I will provide this source code for free.  Just slip
me a message at nater@home.com and I'll send it right to ya.

(beware: the code is probably all nasty and sloppy and inefficient,
so I am making it available for me to learn just as much as anybody
else.  If you do something cool to it, please let me see!)
Also, please keep it freeware with free source code and keep my 
name in it!

----------WEAPONS---------------
All weapons can be detonated in mid-flight by pressing the fire
key again, but be aware that some of them will not reach their
full potential that way.

Bullet - The standard projectile.  They're so small and cheap you
	never run out.

Dirt Blob - A small canister, that when detonated, will release a big
	blob of dirt.  Useful for building barriers or burying an enemy.

Roller - A sturdy, sphere-shaped projectile that will begin to roll
	upon hitting the ground.  They usually roll downhill as far
	as they can before detonating.

Crawler - Similar to a roller, except that the Crawler contains a small
	amount of stored energy that will allow it to roll uphill. 
	When rolling down larger hills they can gain momentum and can
	then travel farther.

Nuke - Just what it's name implies.

Burrower - Will burrow into the ground when it hits.

Digger - Will roll then dig.

Hopper - Will hop after exploding.

Big Ultimate Weapon [not done] - This weapon will split into three 
	separate projectiles, then split again for a total of nine 
	explosions.
